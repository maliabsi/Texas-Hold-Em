			<li> One player will start off as the dealer. The dealer will rotate clockwise after every hand.</li>
			<li> The two players to the left of the dealer are called the small blind (SB) and the big blind (BB). </li>
			<li> The SB and the BB are required to place a bet of a pre-determined amount. They are the only players to
				put money in the pot before the cards are dealt. </li>
			<li> Each player will receive two cards facing down. </li>
			<li> Once the cards have been dealt, the first betting round begins with the player sitting to the left of
				the BB. This player can fold, call (match the amount of the BB), or raise. </li>
			<li> The betting continues clockwise, with each player having the choice to fold, call, bet, or raise.</li>
			<li> When the first round of betting is completed, the three cards in the middle (community cards) are
				flipped face up on the table. This is called the flop.</li>
			<li> Once again, the betting round resumes, clockwise, with each player having the choice to check, bet or
				raise, call, or fold.</li>
			<li> When the second round of betting is completed, a fourth communit card is flipped face up on the table.
				This is called the turn.</li>
			<li> Again, the third round of betting continues with the first remaining player sitting to the left of the
				dealer.</li>
			<li> When the third round of betting is over, a fifth community card is flipped face up on the table. This
				is called the river.</li>
			<li> Lastly, the fourth round of betting starts with the player seated to the left of the dealer. The
				betting continues to move clockwise.</li>
			<li> Using the best five-card combination of the players cards and the community cards, the remaining
				players show their hands. The highest five-card hand wins the pot.</li>
